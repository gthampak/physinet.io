### 1. Introduction

Lagrangian neural networks (LNN) output the Lagrangian for a system in motion. The Lagrangian characterizes the total energy in the system, and is a useful tool for solving for the mechanics of a system where a wider and more general range of dynamics are needed. The LNN was developed for extremely physics-specific tasks, and this makes it relatively narrow in scope. We seek to explore if they are capable of outperforming a more general-purpose neural network that is highly successful at predicting the behavior of chaotic systems, Reservoir Computing (RC), as well as a baseline fully-connected neural network model (FC), the long-short term memory neural network (LSTM). 

The task we will be using for comparison is the mechanics-based problem of forecasting the motion of a chaotic double pendulum. To verify this, we will train these networks on a dataset that is the analytical solution of a double pendulum over time. If RC and LSTM outperforms the physics-specific network, the LNN, then the utility of these networks substantially decreases. However, in this case, we expect LNN to surpass RC and LSTM, as the most common mathematical way to solve for the equations of motion for a double pendulum is by first solving the Lagrangian. Furthermore, we expect the LNN to yield better results than both RC and LSTM as its output has been proven to abide by the laws of physics and conserve energy, whereas RC and LSTM may not necessarily yield outputs that fall within physical constraints. 

To get an understanding of the performance of each of these neural networks against a more common baseline model, we will also be comparing all three of these models against a generic feed-forward network that will serve as the control.

Finally, to test the validity of each model on new data, we will test each model on a set of simulated data, giving them each the same initial conditions. We can then both quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate how each model does to get a better understanding of their respective strengths and weaknesses.

#### 1.1 The Double Pendulum

We choose double pendulum forecasting as our task as it is a dynamical system that is governed by a set of ordinary differential equations that yield substantial chaos. The system consists of a single pendulum with another one attached to the first pendulum's end.

`TODO:` add multiple side by side video comparisons of different initial conditions

From the above videos, we observe that slight differences in the initial conditions of the system result in drastically different paths and trajectories. This makes the system extraordinarily hard to forecast, for slight deviations in path result in substantial error. We can observe this in the equations of motion, which are reached through a derivation with the Lagrangian:

<center><img src="plots/dbl_pend_sample.png" width="325" /></center>

<br>

<center>

$\ddot{\theta_1} = \frac{-m_2cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2)l_1 \dot{\theta_1}^2sin(\theta_1 - \theta_2) + m_2cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2)gsin(\theta_2) - m_2 l_2\dot{\theta_2}^2sin(\theta_1-\theta_2)-(m_1+m_2)gsin(\theta_1)}{l_1(m_1+m_2-m_2cos^2(\theta_1 - \theta_2))}$

<br>

$\ddot{\theta_2} = \frac{(m1+m2)[l_1 \dot{\theta_1}^2 + \frac{\dot{\theta_2}^2sin(\theta_1 - \theta_2)cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2)m_2l_2}{m1+m2} + cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2)gsin(\theta_1) - gsin(\theta_2)]}{l_2 (m_1 + m_2 sin^2(\theta_1 - \theta_2))}$

</center>

where $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ describes the angles created between the pendulum arms and the vertical plane, $m_1$ and $m_2$ describe the masses of the first and second pendulum respectively, and $l_1$ and $l_2$ describe the arm lengths of the first and second pendulum directly. Observing the exponential terms in both equations, it can be inferred that any error will propogate through the system at a large scale, making accurate forecasting of the path to be quite difficult.

### 2. Related works

Similar work on chaotic systems and the double pendulum has been done before. Klinkachorn and Parmar at Stanford characterized the performance of neural networks on double pendulum's as the starting angle between the two pendulum arm's began to vary. However, they tested a range of machine learning algorithms and models, including linear regression, autoregression, feed-forward neural networks, and long-short term memory networks. Rudy et al. also demonstrated a novel method to train models that seek to fit dynamical systems on noisy data, and in this paper compare increasing levels of variance that arise when a neural network is used to predict an increasingly noisy double pendulum input.

Although sharing multiple similarities, our work primarily differs in that we seek to test models that hypothetically ought to perform quite well on this task. The RNN, a more primitive analog to the LSTM, is simply used as a baseline instead of as the most advanced model, and we extend upon prior work by testing LNN, HNN, and RC on the double pendulum task.

### 3. Methods

The dataset used is a double pendulum simulation dataset that generates any required number analytical solutions to the double pendulum problem given a set of initial conditions. This is done computationally and represents the ground truth solution that is derived through the double pendulum's equations of motion. Initially, we planned on building our own dataset with some computer vision code and a double pendulum setup provided by Pomona College Physics Department to test our trained networks on noisy systems (real world double pendulum), however we did not have time to complete this task. The IBM double pendulum dataset used in the beginning of the project provef to be unsatisfactory. It consists of only coordinates from images, which are difficult to parse and expand upon. Eventually we switched to generated analytical dataset. However, the IBM dataset can be put into use in future extension of this project (See future extention section for details.) The simulated dataset, the IBM dataset, and computer vision dataset will provide us with data on the same system with increasing levels of noise.

We trained and optimized a baseline fully-connected neural network (FC), a long-short term neural network (LSTM), an echo state network (reservoir computing, RC), and a Lagrangian Neural Network (LNN). We used PyTorch to implement and train the FC and LSTM networks, and [ReservoirPy](https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy) to implement and train the ESN network (ReservoirPy is a library on github based on Python scientific libraries used as a tool to help implement efficient RC neural networks, specifically ESNs). In the process of exploring ESN libraries, we also looked at "easy-esn", "pytorch-esn", or "EchoTorch". Because LNNs are more physics and mathematics intensive and unique than mainstream neural networks, our LNN is constructed from scratch using existing examples online and on github. The work we relied relatively heavily on in the construction of our LNN is Miles Cranmer et al.â€™s [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04630) and [github repo]((https://github.com/MilesCranmer/lagrangian_nns)) on LNNs with dependencies on more mainstream Python libraries including Jax, NumPy, MoviePy, and celluloid, with the latter two used for visualization purposes.

For analysis, we wrote graphing functions that emulates paths of the double pendulums under different initial conditions over time consistent with the laws of physics. We overlaid the theoretical paths with our network-generated paths to get a clear visual representation of how the different networks perform. We also plotted the differences in predicted angles and analytically calculated angles, as well as the distance between pendulum endpoints for the predicted cartesian coordinates and analytical cartesian coordinates. MSE errors are used onlyto compare LSTM or ESN performances under different hyperparameters, but not across models. Traditionally, F1 score, accuracy, precision, recall, etc. would be considered in the evaluation of model performance, but due to the nature of error propogation for the double pendulum, these metrics are not a good grounds for the latter kind of comparison..

### 4. Discussion: Results and Network Comparisons

To compare these 3 networks, we looked at validation loss and accuracy, and comparing how well they perform on the testing set generated analytically. By comparing the 3 more advanced structured models against the FC baseline, we observed the following results.

#### 4.1 General Overview

We observe the predicted trajectories of each of the models overtime as well as an analytically solved solution:

![Analytical Results](plots/LNN_pendulum_positions_analytic.png) ![LNN Results](plots/LNN_pendulum_positions_model.png) ![ESN Results](plots/ESN_pendulum_positions_model.png) ![LSTM Results](plots/LSTM_tai_init.png) ![FC Results](plots/FC_pendulum_positions.png)

We can also visualize each of these positions continuously in a video:

  <img src="plots/fc.gif" width="500" />
</p>
<center>From left to right, the analytical video, LNN predicted, ESN predicted, LSTM predicted, FC predicted </center>
<br>

From the video, one clear advantage of the LNN in the case of this system is its preservation of physics. Though the path traced does not perfectly align with the analytical solution, the LNN conserves energy in the system, and the total amount of potential and kinetic energy are balanced accordingly. However, the ESN does not abide by the laws of physics, and tends to move about randomly and disobey gravity as well as conservation of energy.

From this broad overview, it is quite obvious that the LNN seems to match the analytical solution the most, while the ESN completely departs from the analytical solution. Taking a look at difference between the distance between x and y positions of the analytical solution and each model prediction, as well as the difference between the angles produced by the analytical solution and the model predictions, we see the following:

![LNN Error - Distance Between Points](plots/LNN_error_distance.png) ![ESN Error - Distance Between Points](plots/ESN_error_distance.png)

![LNN Error - Difference Between Angles](plots/LNN_theta_error.png) ![ESN Error - Difference Between Angles](plots/ESN_theta_error.png)

Visualizations of error report large differences between analytical solutions and model predictions for both models. Since the double pendulum is a highly chaotic system, any small error in the system will propogate over time, rendering all later predictions to be somewhat different from the analytical solution.

#### 4.2 LSTM Model

We note that the LSTM is not really for to the task. With a 3 layer LSTM model with decreasing hidden layer sizes `[32, 16, 8]`, after training 10 epochs on 100 generated analytical samples, an example trial of generation looks like this:

![Model Output](plots/LSTM_pendulum_positions_model.png)![Ground Truth](plots/LSTM_pendulum_positions_analytic.png)

We observe that, although the model learns the spirit of a "chaotic system", it does not really learn the pattern. The outputs are far off from target, and des not even show similar pattern.

Also, the training statistics shows severe overfitting of the data:

![Training and Validating Loss Comparison](plots/LSTM_train_val.png)

We see that over time, the training loss decreases as we expected, but when we validated the model using other simulated data, it does not show similar decrease, hence we can conclude that overfitting happened.

Altering the `learning_rate` does not seem to solve the problem.

`TODO in final version`: add comparison from LSTM.

#### 4.3 LNN Model

The LNN model demonstrates an accurate prediction of the pendulum for the first few prediction frame, but once there is considerable error, the error propagates quickly throughout the system and make the prediction unreliable. For single frame predictions however, we still witness reasonable loss decrease over the course of training:

![LNN Loss](plots/LNN_loss.png)

However, this error during multi-timestep forecasting makes sense since double pendulum is such a chaotic system and error propagates easily. Also, LNN prediction seems to follow the actual physical rules and conserve energy and momentum while making the prediction, which is a virtue most neural networks lack.

#### 4.4 ESN Model

Our ESN model takes as input the triangular functions of the angles formed by the arms and the vertical line. The key hyperparameters for our network are as follows:

```python
leak_rate = 0.1         #Decides the "memory size". higher value -> shorter memory
spectral_radius = 25.0  #Higher values -> chaotic system
input_scaling = 0.5     #Smaller (-> 0) -> free behavior, larger (-> 1) -> input-driven
regularization = 1e-7   #ridge optimization parameter.
forecase = 1            #use the next following frame as label.
```

The ESN trains on entire time series and use the same serie (but one frame later) as label. The network turns out to be extremely inaccurate in learning and predicting the movement of the end joint of the double pendulum.

When we train the model, we noticed that there are 3 sample sequences that induced extremely high MSE error. To protect the network from such "pollution", we had to remove the 3 sequences by hand.

First of all, the prediction accuracy does not depend on the size of the training data. We first trained the ESN on each sample sequence, tested the prediction error (MSE), and then reset the model to untrained state. We then trained another model on the entire dataset (40 sequence) without reset. Figure 1(a) shows the MSE with/without resetting. Figure 1(b) compares the errors from the two models.

![Figure 1](plots/train_size_comp.png)

We see from the figures that the MSE loss are relatively similar for both models, which implies that size of training data has little influence on model precision. This could be accounted to the limited "memory" for an ESN network. When training on large dataset, new incoming data takes away memory space of the network and make it "forgets" earlier inputs that it has learned.

We observe that this is not due to the specific sequence we tested the ESN upon. The sequences varies in their difficulty to train, but the the difference is within range of the error predicting one sequence can produce. This is shown in figure *2*

![Figure 2](plots/MSE_from_each_sequence.png)

Changing the `leak_rate` parameter for a longer term of memory will alter the effect of training size. We trained 2 new models with `leak_rate=0.05` and `leak_rate=0.01`, and compared it with the previous `leak_rate=0.1` model interms of difference of MSE with respect of resetting, using the following formula:

$Diff = MSE_{No\ reset}-MSE_{Reset}$

The results is shown below:
![Figure 3](plots/LR_comp.png)

We see that extremrely small `leak_rate` induce significantly larger MSE difference both above and beyond 0, which means it is highly unstable. Comparing `0.05` and `0,1`, we find that lowering `leak_rate` results in difference mostly below 0, which means in that case larger training size generally gives smaller error. However, It is also most unstable since there are cases where larger training dataset induced significantly high error.

Another way we can see the ineffectiveness of larger training data is that, in the no resetting case, our $x$ axis can be treated as time passed, and we see that the MSE does not shown any decrease pattern (see fig 1a).

The discussion above shows how the ESN model is not making valid predictions. Our main assumption is that the motion of the double pendulumn is overall circular. When more data are fed into the network, it learns nothing else but the circular motion. When less data are fed, either there are not enough data to learn from, or that it can only learn the local movement (which is often quite linear). The latter case also explaines why sometimes the prediction gives a linear trajectory that goes way beyond reasonable value -- It could have learnt a linear trend.

#### 4.5 Conclusion

The main reason making predicting double pendulum difficult is that, since double pendulum is a second order system, the error propagates throughout the system quickly, and combined with the instability of neural networks, making accurate prediction becomes extremely difficult.

This result proves our assumption that all 3 of RNN (LSTM), ESN and LNN are not very accurate at predicting double pendulum, but overall ESN< RNN < LNN . This also proves our assumption that LNN makes a physically credible prediction and is able to learn the actual physical rules of the system.

### 5. Ethical Implication and Discussion

A possible ethical issue in this instance is the use of overideal training data. The IBM double pendulum dataset that was initially used for training is a dataset that is clean and not noisy: it is filmed with a high speed camera in a controlled environment, with carefully measured axis markers and angular values. However, it is possible that the models we train with this dataset are incapable of handling a noisy system, such as validation on a user-generated double pendulum path. We will analyze this issue in our validation of each model with the Pomona College double pendulum. 
 
This ethical implication has far reaching issues in multiple areas. If a trained model is only able to operate in the space of clean data, then in certain edge-cases or uncommon cases, the model will experience a high error rate. This is especially alarming in areas such as facial or speech recognition, where there may be high amounts of variation in the noisiness of images or audio, and error may result in a range of consequences from inconvenience to life-changing.

Another ethical concern that might rise from our project is the energy consumption. Our model is trained on small dataset and short epoch, so the energy consumption is neglectable. However, if such research is conducted on larger scale, with a plethora of issues that might rise, training multiple models will leave a significant carbon footprint.

### 6. Reflection

There are multiple things that we could have done better throughout this project.

First of all, we should have reached out to authors and researchers in the earlier stage for help. It turned out that they were pretty responsive and excited to have people working on extensions to their projects. If we did it earlier, we would have wasted less time and resource. We also should have started training our networks earlier so we would have more time to make adjustments and tune our hyperparameters more. We should also refer closely to more literature to avoid using methods that were proved ineffective. We should also leave more time to deeply train our neural network. We did not train the network over a huge dataset, which may make the results less representative.

Another improvement would be to do more research on how to compare different kinds of Neural Networks and how to make sure we're not putting in more time or effort into one or the other. For example theoretically LNNs are supposed to perform the best. We need to findout whether it performed the best in our research not because of reseacher bias but because it actually is better.

One important thing we have learned from this project is that we should settle upon an interface or some sort of standard at the beginning of implementing the codes. In our project, trying to convert data from one's file to another's has taken up a lot of time, and that could be easily avoided if we have established some standard.

If this project are to be continued, we think there are 3 more ways we can extend. The first extension is to implement a Hamiltonian Neural Network, and compare how it performs with our existing models, especially with our LNN since they are both physics oriented. Secondly, to introduce more dataset. We mentioned the IBM dataset, and a possible Pomona College dataset that we can generate on our own. With more dataset we can look into how noise interfere with training and predicting of double pendulum. We should also examine if sampling density of the dataset has any influence. Thirdly, to apply more statistical metrics for network comparison.
