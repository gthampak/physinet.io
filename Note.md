### Ziang @ 10.23
 I've build a runnable train/test script in the running notebook. Please refer to it when building the RNN baseline and other models. Currently the code is runnable but performance of the model is just super bad. Will look into it later.

 I have also moved the datasets to /raid/cs152/zxaa2018/penndulum/ according to Prof. Clark's guide, and updated the directories in the notebook so y'all don't have to worry about it. If you are concerned with disk space use on your virtual machine you can also remove the dataset from your own directory -- One copy in the raid directory will work.
