# Literature Review for the project.

## Some possible papers we can refer to:

Cranmer, M., Greydanus, S., Hoyer, S., Battaglia, P., Spergel, D., & Ho, S. (2020, July 30). [*Lagrangian neural networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04630).

- Compared to regular NN, HNN are better in learning symmetries and conservation law, but requires coordinates of system to be canoncial. LHH does not require this. Theories about lagrangian is included and 3 different experiments are performed, including double pendulum. Codes are provided [here](https://github.com/MilesCranmer/lagrangian_nns). It also has a really helpful reference list.

- This is a very basic introduction on double pendulums and some math included. Feels very general but included it anyways.

Woolley, Jonathan W., P. K. Agarwal, and John Baker. [*Modeling and prediction of chaotic systems with artificial neural networks*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/fld.2117). International journal for numerical methods in fluids 63.8 (2010): 989-1004.

- A paper about chaotic systems in general (not specific to double pendulum or phenomena in physics). Chaotic systems such as earthquakes, laser systems, epileptic seizures, combustion, and weather patterns are very difficult to predict. This study attempts to develop a system for training artificial neural networks t predict the future data of processes. Data set was obtained by solving Lorenz's equations. Backpropagation algorithm is used to train the network. "A correlation of 94% and a negative Lyapunov exponent indicate that the results obtained from ANN are in good agreement with the actual values."

- A network structure called Deep Lagrangian Networks is presented. Previous works seldomly combined NN and differential equations. The paper gives an introduction on Lagrangian mechanics and the math of fitting it into NN. The team did a 2-dof robot simulation (what's the relationship between double pendulum?) experiment with their NN.
