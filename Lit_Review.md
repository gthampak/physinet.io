# Literature Review for the project.

## Some possible papers we can refer to:

Cranmer, M., Greydanus, S., Hoyer, S., Battaglia, P., Spergel, D., & Ho, S. (2020, July 30). [*Lagrangian neural networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04630).

- This paper talks about Lagrangian neural networks, which I assume will be used in the project. One nice thing about this paper is that it included a test of the LNN on double pendulum, which shows that LNNs are more accurate in predicting the total energy of the system.
I think it also have a really helpful reference list.

- This is a very basic introduction on double pendulums and some math included. Feels very general but included it anyways.
