# Literature Review for the project.

## Some possible papers we can refer to:

Cranmer, M., Greydanus, S., Hoyer, S., Battaglia, P., Spergel, D., & Ho, S. (2020, July 30). [*Lagrangian neural networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04630).

- Compared to regular NN, HNN are better in learning symmetries and conservation law, but requires coordinates of system to be canoncial. LHH does not require this. Theories about lagrangian is included and 3 different experiments are performed, including double pendulum. Codes are provided [here](https://github.com/MilesCranmer/lagrangian_nns). It also have a really helpful reference list.

- This is a very basic introduction on double pendulums and some math included. Feels very general but included it anyways.
